by [Woojin Kim](http://woojink.com/), [Marily Konstantinopoulou](http://marilykonstantinopoulou.com/), A'Nisa Megginson, Manuel Rueda at [MoMA Untitled: Art Datathon](http://www.moma.org/calendar/events/1793)

Using the [MoMA](http://www.moma.org/)'s exhibition history dataset kindly provided by the museum for the event, we take a look at MoMA through time, between 1929 and 1990. See the project live here: http://woojink.com/moma/
